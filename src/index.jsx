//Create a React app from scratch.
//Show a single h1 that says "Good morning" if between midnight and 12PM.
//or "Good Afternoon" if between 12PM and 6PM.
//or "Good evening" if between 6PM and midnight.
//Apply the "heading" style in the styles.css
//Dynamically change the color of the h1 using inline css styles.
//Morning = red, Afternoon = green, Night = blue.

// If you're running this locally in VS Code use the commands:
